#### TYPE OF PROJECT: Data Cleaning, Data Analysis and Visualization

__Project Status:__ __`Completed`__

__Overview:__
A new executive was elected in an association. Part of their first assignment was to recover the debt owed by members of the association since its inception.
My job as a data analyst was to conduct a debt analysis and present my findings using meaningful visualizations to help the executive understand the debt burden of members of the association. 

__Skills Used in the Project__
* Data cleaning skill with EXCEL
* Data analysis skill with Tableau
* Data visualization (dashboard) skill with Tableau

**Findings and Recommendations:**
My analysis revealed that 23 individuals out of the 121 members of the association owed over 34% of the total debt. Therefore, to save resources and ensure quick recovery of debts, it was suggested that a debt recovery committee be instituted and they should start the debt recovery process with the 23 individuals that are most indebted to the association.

#### TYPE OF PROJECT: Data Cleaning, Data Analysis and Visualization

__Overview:__
A new executive was elected in an association. Part of their first assignment was to recover the debt owed by members of the association since its inception.
My job as a data analyst was to conduct a debt analysis and present my findings using meaningful visualizations to help the executive understand the debt burden of members of the association. 

__Skills Used in the Project__
* Data cleaning skill with EXCEL
* Data analysis skill with Tableau
* Data visualization (dashboard) skill with Tableau

**Findings and Recommendations:**
My analysis revealed that 23 individuals out of the 121 members of the association owed over 34% of the total debt. Therefore, to save resources and ensure quick recovery of debts, it was suggested that a debt recovery committee be instituted and they should start the debt recovery process with the 23 individuals that are most indebted to the association.

#### TYPE OF PROJECT: Data gathering, Data cleaning, Data Analysis and Visualization

__Overview:__
This is a personal project where I intended to practise and showcase my webscraping skills. I scrapped a real estate website and presented a descriptive summary of properties advertised in the website. 

__Skills Used in the Project__
* Webscraping skill with PYTHON (Beautiful Soup library)
* Data cleaning skill with EXCEL
* Data analysis with Pivot table
* Data visualization (dashboard) skill with EXCEL Pivot Charts

**Findings and Recommendations:**
The descriptive summary obtained at the end of this project could guide real estate businesses on the choice of summary statistics that could be included in their websites to make them user-friendly and increase customers' satisfaction.
